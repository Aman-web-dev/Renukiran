        <p className="w-[80vw] m-auto text-center text-lg my-4 text-gray-500">At Renukiran we focus on comprehensive Skill Development Project designed to empower marginalized communities with digital literacy and spoken English skills. In an increasingly digital world, access to these skills is vital for economic empowerment and social inclusion. Marginalized communities often face barriers to accessing quality education and economic opportunities, which perpetuate cycles of poverty and exclusion. By providing training and support to marginalized individuals, we aim to bridge the digital divide and enhance their employability and overall quality of life. Through our project we address these challenges by equipping individuals from marginalized backgrounds with essential skills in digital literacy and spoken English, thereby expanding their access to employment and education.</p>

        <p className="w-[80vw] m-auto text-center text-lg my-4 text-gray-500">Childhood undernutrition is a pressing issue that affects millions of underprivileged and needy children in both urban and rural areas across national and international borders. Lack of access to nutritious food not only jeopardizes health but also hinders their cognitive development, educational outcomes, and prospects. It is a multifaceted problem that includes undernutrition, resulting in stunted growth and underweight children. Both urban and rural landscapes face distinct challenges related to child malnutrition. While urban children may suffer from a lack of access to affordable, nutritious food, rural areas often struggle with issues like food insecurity and limited healthcare facilities. We make significant contribution to alleviating food insecurity among underprivileged and needy children in both urban and rural areas. By providing access to nutritious food, coupled with education and sustainable practices, we aspire to break the cycle of malnutrition and empower these children to lead healthier and more prosperous lives. Our project in project's rationale lies in the recognition that adequate nutrition is a fundamental human right and a key determinant of a child's growth and development. </p>



        <p className="my-4 w-[80vw] text-lg m-auto text-center text-black"> Further, we do deepen advocacy, awareness and needful implementation for access to clean water, proper sanitation, and good hygiene practices are fundamental human rights that are often denied to underprivileged communities in India. Our intervention is outlined through comprehensive WASH project approach aimed at improving the living conditions and health outcomes of underprivileged populations by addressing their water, sanitation, and hygiene needs.</p>
