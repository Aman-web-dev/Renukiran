Our organisational vision and Mission initiated through shared dream of Avinash Kumar (our founder and the inquisitive little boy of Renu Ji) and his mother. The dream was to inculcate through teaching & training, educating, and help develop life skills that are much essential in bringing a 360-degree shift in the lives of people who have inadequate, insufficient, access and availability to the basic aids in living a dignified life.
