        <div className="md:space-y-2 lg:space-y-4">
    <p className='sub-text-400'>
      Renukiran started as a shared dream between our founder, Avinash Kumar, and his
      mother, Renu Ji. Renu Ji envisioned a world where everyone could live a life of dignity
      through education, training, and essential life skills. After her passing from cancer,
      Avinash, along with Pooja Gupta, turned this dream into reality.
    </p>
    <p className='sub-text-400'>
      The journey began in 2013 when Avinash and Pooja would teach children from farming
      and daily wage families living near the Yamuna riverbanks in Delhi. After office hours
      and on weekends, they taught, distributed food, organized healthcare camps, and
      conducted WASH (Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene) campaigns.
    </p>
    <p className='sub-text-400'>
      Their efforts culminated in the official establishment of Renukiran Welfare Foundation
      in 2018. With endless energy and passion, the organization focuses on uplifting
      underprivileged children, women, and communities across India.
